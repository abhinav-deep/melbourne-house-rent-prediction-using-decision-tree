This model predicts the house rents for Melbourne city using decision tree algorithm.
Dataset used for training the model is https://www.kaggle.com/spotbox/melbourne-house-prices.
We find out the best tree size by passing different arbitary values for the tree size and storing the mean absolute error for each value.
Finally select the tree size with the minimum mean absolute error to create our final model.
